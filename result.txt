markably fit 90-year-old Sherwood-
ian walks in almost immediately.
He dazzles me with his memory,
his firm grip on names and dates,
his British accent, his delightful
wit and his old-world courtesy that
includes holding doors open and
walking me down to my car when
the interview is done.
When he recounts tales of his
brother's bravery, there is pride in
his voice; when he speaks about
how the schoolboy Somi would
march the kids in the neighbour-
hood up and down, he smiles
nostalgically. And when he tells
me about Somi's infatuation with a
very young girl when he last came
to meet the family in Rawalpindi in
1947, he chuckles like a schoolboy,
refusing outright to tell me more.

'We don't discuss ladies,' he says
gallantly. I am disarmed with his
charm, but what impresses me
most is the lucid manner in which
he recounts the Battle of Badgam
and makes Somnath Sharma and
the '47 war with Pakistan come
alive in front of my eyes.

Badgam, Jammu and Kashmir
3 November 1947

Resting his plastered left arm on the
edge of the trench, Maj Somnath
Sharma raises his head and squints at
the sun; it has moved west but there
are still a few hours of daylight left.
He has to move his company soon and
if they make good time, they can be
back at the Srinagar airfield by night.
It has been a tense and gruelling

morning, but now he is feeling quite
relaxed.
At first light that day, a fighting
patrol comprising A and D Companies
of 4 Kumaon (under Somi) and one
company of 1 Para Kumaon (under
Captain Ronald Wood) had been sent
to Badgam after intelligence reports
had warned that a 1000-strong
lashkar of Pathans, led by Pakistan
Army regulars, was heading towards
Srinagar. Their aim, the reports had
said, was to take over Srinagar air-
field and thus handicap the Army by
cutting off their supplies. The fighting
patrol's job had been to search for the
raiders and engage them at Badgam,
a small village three to four miles
from the Srinagar airfield.
Early morning, Sharma had
reported that his company was posi-
tioned on a hillock west of the village
and that they had dug trenches there.

1 Para Kumaon had established
themselves southeast of the village
and had reported that the village
was quiet and peaceful. Sharma had
also reported that the villagers had
been going about their chores quietly
though they looked scared. He has
also noticed that some of them were
clustered in a nala where they seemed
to be taking shelter. Since Badgam
appeared peaceful, 1 Para Kumaon
was ordered to ‘circle east and search;
and then return to the airfield after
making contact with 1 Punjab'. They
did so, and were back in Srinagar by 1
p. m.
Since Badgam is quiet, Sharma is
also ordered to start pulling his com-
panies out. At 2 p. m. he reports that
A Company, which had been ordered
to circle to the west, had done so and
was also on its way to the airfield.
Somi plans to keep D Company in

Badgam till late evening and then
withdraw to the airfield. His decision
is supported by Brig. L. P. Sen, DSO.
The two know each other well from
battles in the Arakan in 1944-45.
The soldiers are just biding time since
there are only a few hours to go.

The general stops for a breather and
a sip of the lemonade that has ap-
peared by our sides and then shakes
his head gravely. ‘The people Somi
had mistaken for villagers in the
nala were in fact Pathans dressed
as Kashmiri locals with weapons
hidden under their loose chogas, ‘
he grimaces.
The lashkar was arriving in
Badgam in bits and pieces to conceal
their movement and it was led by a
Pakistani major, who was hatching
a crafty plan even as he watched

the soldiers of the Indian Army
patrolling the village. He had asked
his men to mix with the locals and
wait for the rest of the Pathans,
who were quietly making their way
to Badgam after slowly trooping
in through the gap between the
ranges at Gulmarg. He planned to
attack Badgam when they reached a
count of around 1000 men and then
advance to the Srinagar airfield.
Pakistan's plan was to attack the air-
field, cut off the Army's access and
then takeover Jammu and Kashmir.
‘It was a great plan, ‘the general
acknowledges grudgingly.
Around 2 p. m., well after A
Company left Badgam, the vil-
lagers grouped in the nala began
to disperse. While Sharma and his
men thought they were returning
to their homes, they were quietly
positioning themselves around D

Company. The Pakistani major had
decided not to wait beyond after-
noon and as soon as he had about
700 men, he launched his attack.
Sharma and his company, consist-
ing of about 90 men, were the only
ones left to fight the raiders. They
were outnumbered seven to one.

Wrinkling his forehead in an effort
to remember, Lt Gen Sharma says
it was around 2. 30 p. m. that Somi
and his men were taken by surprise
when gunfire started coming at
them from the village. Soon, they
were receiving machine-gun fire as
well. Somi reported to his brigade
commander that his position was
under attack. He added that he
was apprehensive about returning
fire in the direction of the village
because he could hurt innocent peo-

ple, including women and children.
By then, the raiders had started
coming up in large numbers from a
depression in the west.
‘There were hundreds of
them, and they started targeting
Somi's company with mortar and
automatic fire,' says Lt Gen Sharma.
'Since the Pathans were not trained
soldiers, every 100 men were com-
manded by a Viceroy's Commis-
sioned Officer (VCO) while every 10
men had a regular Pakistani Army
soldier with them who inspired
them to fight. '
Lt Gen Sharma says he heard from
soldiers of 4 Kumaon who returned
alive from the battle how Somi
encouraged his men to retaliate
and, completely unmindful of his
own safety, rushed from one trench
to another urging them to fight
back bravely. Such was the grit and

determination of the men that the
first few attacks, which came from
different directions, were success-
fully repulsed.
The Pathans, however, drew
strength from sheer numbers and
began to increase the pressure.
Soon they had surrounded D Com-
pany from three sides and started
climbing up the hillock where
the trenches were. They came in
hordes, brandishing automatics
and shouting Allah ho Akbar!'
Somi knew he was outnumbered.
He called the brigade commander
and asked for ammunition and
reinforcements. He was told that 1
Punjab was being sent for their sup-
port but Somi realized they would
take time to get there since they had
to move in battle formation. He also
understood how important it was to
hold back the enemy till reinforce-

ments could be sent to close the
gap leading to Srinagar. If that was
not done, the raiders could advance
right up to the airfield and take over
Srinagar.
Somi decided to hold back tena-
ciously and urged his men to fight
to the last. It is to their credit that
they did, despite the fact that they
were completely outnumbered and
their. 303 rifles were no match for
the enemy's medium machine guns.
'Somi knew his company would
not be able to hold out for long but
he did not let his men lose confi-
dence. With complete disregard for
his own safety, he rushed across
the open ground in full view of the
enemy and went about encouraging
his men. When the heavy casualties
started affecting the men manning
the light machine guns, Somi him-
self went around, using his good

hand-his left arm was in plaster
-to fill magazines and hand these
over to the light machine gunners.
He would tell them when and where
to fire.
"Idhar maro, udhar maro," he
would say, and the battle raged for
almost five hours,' the general tells
me. ‘That was precious time for the
Indian Army, since the raiders were
being delayed and they were getting
time to plug the gaps as they built
up strength with Indian Air Force
planes flying in more troops.'
Eventually, the men started
running out of ammunition. When
Somi informed brigade headquar-
ters (HQ) about this, he was asked to
pull back. He refused outright. 'The
enemy is only 50 yards from us. We
are heavily outnumbered. We are
under devastating fire. I shall not
withdraw an inch but will fight to

the last man and the last round, '
was his last message to the HQ.
Just a few minutes later, while he
was crouched in a trench next to
the Bren gunner, helping him load
the gun, a mortar shell landed on
the open ammunition box next to
them. An eardrum-shattering blast
rent the air. ‘It blew up Somi, his
sahayak (an officer's helper or man
Friday who looks after his uniform
and turnout), the machine gun-
ner and a JCO, who was standing
nearby, 'recounts Lt Gen Sharma,
his voice gentle.
For Somi, who had insisted upon
leading his company to Kashmir
despite having his arm in plaster, it
was all over. But it is considered a
credit to his leadership that the men
under his command kept his word.
The non-commissioned officers
(NCOs) of the company decided to

fight on, and they managed to hold
back the raiders for another hour
even after Somi had died.
In fact, as the ammunition
became desperately short, another
hero emerged. Lt Gen Sharma talks
with great respect about Lance Naik
Balwant Singh of D Company, who
took a brave initiative when most
of the soldiers were left with just
one round or two. ‘He asked them
to collect whatever rounds were left
with them and hand those over to
him. He then loaded his gun with
these two or three magazines and
told the rest of the men to retreat
while he held up the enemy. “There
is no point in everybody dying," he
said. "I will hold them back for the
few minutes you need to disappear
into the fields."
'So he and three others stayed
back to battle the raiders while the

rest left the hillock from the back.
Shooting the last of their rounds,
these four bravehearts got out of
their trenches and charged at the
enemy. They were killed but they
helped their comrades survive,' re-
calls the general.
Overall, the brave action of D
Company resulted in the raiders
being delayed by close to six hours
by which time the Indian Army
had managed to get into position
and block the enemy advance to
Srinagar airfield. As aircrafts con-
tinued to fly in with more and more
soldiers, the airfield defence had
become strong enough to stop any
attack.
On the morning of 5 November,
Badgam was counterattacked by
the Indian Army and captured. The
bodies of 300 raiders were counted,
which proved just how ruthless the

fight had been. The retaliatory fire
had been so harsh that the Pathans
had not been able to pick up their
dead. Since they were not trained
soldiers, they were not used to
losing men in such a big way. The
big losses broke their resolve and
they started pulling back. When the
Army took over Badgam, they found
the Pakistanis retreating. ‘When
a man's will is broken, he cannot
fight, ‘ says Lt Gen Sharma.
In the battle of Badgam, 4 Ku-
maon lost Maj Somnath Sharma,
Subedar Prem Singh Mehta and
20 other ranks. Twenty-six people
were wounded in the operation. For
his gallantry, tenacious defence and
exemplary leadership that inspired
his men to fight the enemy, in spite
of being outnumbered seven to one,
Maj Somnath Sharma was awarded
the Param Vir Chakra (PVC) posthu-

mously. It was the first PVC of inde-
pendent India.

We have come to the end of the
interview and, as I switch off my
Dictaphone, the general stands
before a beautiful oil painting of his
brother, which hangs on the wall.
The late Maj Somnath Sharma of D
Company, 4 Kumaon, is standing in
his uniform, ribbons on his chest.
He looks handsome and proud.
Lt Gen Sharma turns away with a
distant look in his eyes. ‘Somi died.
He was not there to die, he was
there to kill. A job had to be done.
It was his job and he did it,' he says.
There is steel in his voice.
Somi doesn't answer. A half smile
plays on his lips.

Maj Somnath Sharma was born on
31 January 1923, in Jammu. His
father, Amarnath Sharma, was a
medical corps officer, who rose to
the rank of major general. Of his
two brothers, Surindra Nath, better
known as Tindy in Army circles,
went on to become the engineer-
in-chief. The youngest, Vishwa
Nath, joined the armoured corps
and went on to become the Chief
of Army Staff in 1988. Of his two
sisters, Kamla joined the Army as a
doctor and married an Army officer,
who also rose to the rank of Major
General; the other, Manorama, also
married a brigadier in the Army.
When Tindy was four years old,
his father was detailed to do a med-
ical course in England and decided
to take his wife along. Somi and
Tindy, who were about one year
apart, were put in Hampton Court

Convent in Mussoorie. Though Somi
was older, they were put in the
same class and made a good team.
The two remained boarders there,
happy to be in the same dormitory.
'We got kicked around by seniors,
but Somi was my protector because
he was tougher and bigger than me,
' remembers Tindy. I was the brains
behind the pair, I was very good at
math, and he was more into out-
door stuff. Other than history and
general knowledge, Somi was just
not interested in studies.'
The deal between the brothers
was that while Somi would pro-
tect Tindy from the bullies, Tindy
would finish all the homework in
the evening so that Somi could get
up early and copy it. Both went on
to study at Sherwood from where
Somi, who always wanted to join
the Army, applied for admission to

the Prince of Wales's Royal Indian
Military College (now Rashtriya In-
dian Military College), Dehradun.
After passing out in May 1941 he
joined the Indian Military Academy
(IMA) where he did exceptionally
well. By then the war had started
and IMA training was cut short.
After about nine months of train-
ing, Somi became a commissioned
officer in February 1942. He was
just 19 when he joined the 8/19 Hy-
derabad Regiment, now 4 Kumaon,
as a second lieutenant. He faced
action in Arakan where one of the
toughest battles of the Burma War
was fought with the Japanese on the
Arakan coast where three Indian
battalions landed, along with one
battalion of British commandos.
That was where Somi saw a
wounded Kumaoni soldier sitting
against a tree. He asked the man to

run but when he replied that he was

and battle-hardy Somi carried the
man on his back, right through
Japanese crossfire, laughing all
the way, and bringing him back to
safety. The two were not shot, possi-
bly because the Japanese respected
raw courage.
Returning to India as a major and
the adjutant of 4 Kumaon, Somi got
busy in internal security duties in
various parts of Punjab and helping
the police and civil authorities in
controlling civil disturbances in
1947. Many educational institu-
tions in Delhi still talk of his great
powers of organization in arranging
supplies of rations and safe move-
ment of people from one locality to
another. He was made in charge of
a flying squad of men with jeeps,
who would assist the police in con-

trolling civil disturbances in Delhi.
His amicable but firm command
instilled confidence and discipline
in many difficult situations.
The same was tested when
hostilities broke out in Kashmir in
1947, and India decided to send her
troops to save Kashmir from the
Pakistani raiders. Though Somi's
left arm was in plaster due to an old
wrist-fracture suffered doing gym-
nastics, he insisted on going with
his company. As he was so keen to
go, the commanding officer finally
agreed and ordered him to fly in
and command two companies of 4
Kumaon tasked with the protection
of Srinagar airfield. There are some
priceless black and white pictures
of him with his arm in a cast, taken
at Safdarjung Airport, where he is

with the thought of being with his
men in war.
When Somi landed in Srinagar in
late October, the raiders were clos-
ing in on Baramulla with Badgam
on route. That was where a bloody
battle would be fought and the
brave young officer would bring
home the first Param Vir Chakra of
independent India.
Somi's life story is often quoted
in books and Army messes. It is a
tale of sheer courage and glory. The
example set by him is recounted
with a lot of respect and he is fondly
remembered not only by 4 Kumaon
but the entire armed forces. To en-
sure that young soldiers continue
to be inspired by his bravery, the
training ground at the Kumaon
Regimental Centre in Ranikhet
has been named Somnath Sharma
Ground. A beautiful red brick gate-
