1.1 / CYBERSECURITY, INFORMATION SECURITY, AND NETWORK SECURITY 23
1.1 CYBERSECURITY, INFORMATION SECURITY,
AND NETWORK SECURITY
It would be useful to start this chapter with a definition of the terms cybersecurity, infor-
mation security, and network security. A reasonably comprehensive definition of cyber-
security is:
Cybersecurity is the protection of information that is stored, transmitted, and pro-
cessed in a networked system of computers, other digital devices, and network devices
and transmission lines, including the Internet. Protection encompasses confidentiality,
integrity, availability, authenticity, and accountability. Methods of protection include
organizational policies and procedures, as well as technical means such as encryption
and secure communications protocols.
As subsets of cybersecurity, we can define the following:
■ Information security: This term refers to preservation of confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information. In addition, other properties, such
as authenticity, accountability, nonrepudiation, and reliability can also be
involved.
■ Network security: This term refers to protection of networks and their service
from unauthorized modification, destruction, or disclosure, and provision of
assurance that the network performs its critical functions correctly and there
are no harmful side effects.
Cybersecurity encompasses information security, with respect to electronic
information, and network security. Information security also is concerned with phys-
ical (e.g., paper-based) information. However, in practice, the terms cybersecurity
and information security are often used interchangeably.
Security Objectives
The cybersecurity definition introduces three key objectives that are at the heart of
information and network security:
■ Confidentiality: This term covers two related concepts:
Data¹ confidentiality: Assures that private or confidential information is
not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
1We can define information as communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or
opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or au-
diovisual; and data as information with a specific representation that can be produced, processed, or
stored by a computer. Security literature typically does not make much of a distinction, nor does this
book.
```

24 CHAPTER 1/ INFORMATION AND NETWORK SECURITY CONCEPTS
– Privacy: Assures that individuals control or influence what information
related to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom
that information may be disclosed.
■Integrity: This term covers two related concepts:
– Data integrity: Assures that data (both stored and in transmitted packets)
and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner. This
concept also encompasses data authenticity, which means that a digital object
is indeed what it claims to be or what it is claimed to be, and nonrepudiation,
which is assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of
delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identity, so
neither can later deny having processed the information.
– System integrity: Assures that a system performs its intended function in
an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized
manipulation of the system.
■Availability: Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to
authorized users.
These three concepts form what is often referred to as the CIA triad. The three
concepts embody the fundamental security objectives for both data and for informa-
tion and computing services. For example, the NIST standard FIPS 199 (Standards
for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems) lists
confidentiality, integrity, and availability as the three security objectives for infor-
mation and for information systems. FIPS 199 provides a useful characterization
of these three objectives in terms of requirements and the definition of a loss of
security in each category:
■Confidentiality: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access
and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and propri-
etary information. A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of
information.
■Integrity: Guarding against improper information modification or destruc-
tion, including ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity. A loss
of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.
■Availability: Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.
A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an
information system.
Although the use of the CIA triad to define security objectives is well estab-
lished, some in the security field feel that additional concepts are needed to pres-
ent a complete picture (Figure 1.1). Two of the most commonly mentioned are as
follows:
■ Authenticity: The property of being genuine and being able to be verified and
trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message
originator. This means verifying that users are who they say they are and that
each input arriving at the system came from a trusted source.

■ Accountability: The security goal that generates the requirement for actions
of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity. This supports nonrepudiation,
deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, and after-action
recovery and legal action. Because truly secure systems are not yet an achiev-
able goal, we must be able to trace a security breach to a responsible party.
Systems must keep records of their activities to permit later forensic analysis
to trace security breaches or to aid in transaction disputes.
The Challenges of Information Security
Information and network security are both fascinating and complex. Some of the
reasons follow:
1. Security is not as simple as it might first appear to the novice. The require-
ments seem to be straightforward; indeed, most of the major requirements for
security services can be given self-explanatory, one-word labels: confidential-
ity, authentication, nonrepudiation, and integrity. But the mechanisms used to
meet those requirements can be quite complex, and understanding them may
involve rather subtle reasoning.
2. In developing a particular security mechanism or algorithm, one must always
consider potential attacks on those security features. In many cases, successful
attacks are designed by looking at the problem in a completely different way,
therefore exploiting an unexpected weakness in the mechanism.
3. Because of point 2, the procedures used to provide particular services are
often counterintuitive. Typically, a security mechanism is complex, and it is not
obvious from the statement of a particular requirement that such elaborate
measures are needed. It is only when the various aspects of the threat are con-
sidered that elaborate security mechanisms make sense.
4. Having designed various security mechanisms, it is necessary to decide where
to use them. This is true both in terms of physical placement (e.g., at what points
```



Page 6

26 CHAPTER 1 / INFORMATION AND NETWORK SECURITY CONCEPTS
in a network are certain security mechanisms needed) and in a logical sense
[e.g., at what layer or layers of an architecture such as TCP/IP (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) should mechanisms be placed].
5. Security mechanisms typically involve more than a particular algorithm or
protocol. They also require that participants be in possession of some secret
information (e.g., an encryption key), which raises questions about the cre-
ation, distribution, and protection of that secret information. There also may
be a reliance on communications protocols whose behavior may complicate
the task of developing the security mechanism. For example, if the proper
functioning of the security mechanism requires setting time limits on the tran-
sit time of a message from sender to receiver, then any protocol or network
that introduces variable, unpredictable delays may render such time limits
meaningless.
6. Information and network security are essentially a battle of wits between a
perpetrator who tries to find holes and the designer or administrator who tries
to close them. The great advantage that the attacker has is that he or she need
only find a single weakness, while the designer must find and eliminate all
weaknesses to achieve perfect security.
7. There is a natural tendency on the part of users and system managers to per-
ceive little benefit from security investment until a security failure occurs.
8. Security requires regular, even constant, monitoring, and this is difficult in
today's short-term, overloaded environment.
9. Security is still too often an afterthought to be incorporated into a system after
the design is complete rather than being an integral part of the design process.
10. Many users and even security administrators view strong security as an imped-
iment to efficient and user-friendly operation of an information system or use
of information.
The difficulties just enumerated will be encountered in numerous ways as we
examine the various security threats and mechanisms throughout this book.
1.2 THE OSI SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
To assess effectively the security needs of an organization and to evaluate and
choose various security products and policies, the manager responsible for security
needs some systematic way of defining the requirements for security and character-
izing the approaches to satisfying those requirements. This is difficult enough in a
centralized data processing environment; with the use of local and wide area net-
works, the problems are compounded.
ITU-T Recommendation X.800, Security Architecture for OSI, defines
such a systematic approach. The open systems interconnection (OSI) security
architecture is useful to managers as a way of organizing the task of providing
security. Furthermore, because this architecture was developed as an interna-
tional standard, computer and communications vendors have developed security
```

features for their products and services that relate to this structured definition of
services and mechanisms.
For our purposes, the OSI security architecture provides a useful, if abstract,
overview of many of the concepts that this book deals with. The OSI security archi-
tecture focuses on security attacks, mechanisms, and services. These can be defined
briefly as:
■ Security attack: Any action that compromises the security of information
owned by an organization.
■ Security mechanism: A process (or a device incorporating such a process) that
is designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack.
■ Security service: A processing or communication service that enhances the
security of the data processing systems and the information transfers of an
organization. The services are intended to counter security attacks, and they
make use of one or more security mechanisms to provide the service.
In the literature, the terms threat and attack are commonly used, with the
following meanings:
■ Threat: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact
organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation),
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through
an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modifi-
cation of information, and/or denial of service.
■ Attack: Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny,
degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.
The following three sections provide an overview of the concepts of attacks,
services, and mechanisms. The key concepts that are covered are summarized in
Figure 1.2.

1.3 SECURITY ATTACKS
A useful means of classifying security attacks, used both in X.800, is in terms of
passive attacks and active attacks (Figure 1.2a). A passive attack attempts to learn or
make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources. An
active attack attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.

Passive Attacks
Passive attacks are in the nature of eavesdropping on, or monitoring of, transmis-
sions. The goal of the attacker is to obtain information that is being transmitted. Two
types of passive attacks are the release of message contents and traffic analysis.
The release of message contents is easily understood. A telephone conver-
sation, an electronic mail message, and a transferred file may contain sensitive or
confidential information. We would like to prevent an opponent from learning the
contents of these transmissions.

Figure 1.2 Key Concepts in Security
A second type of passive attack, traffic analysis, is subtler. Suppose that we
had a way of masking the contents of messages or other information traffic so that
opponents, even if they captured the message, could not extract the information
from the message. The common technique for masking contents is encryption. If we
had encryption protection in place, an opponent might still be able to observe the
pattern of these messages. The opponent could determine the location and identity
of communicating hosts and could observe the frequency and length of messages
being exchanged. This information might be useful in guessing the nature of the
communication that was taking place.
Passive attacks are very difficult to detect because they do not involve any
alteration of the data. Typically, the message traffic is sent and received in an appar-
ently normal fashion and neither the sender nor receiver is aware that a third party
```

1.3 / SECURITY ATTACKS 29
has read the messages or observed the traffic pattern. However, it is feasible to pre-
vent the success of these attacks, usually by means of encryption. Thus, the emphasis
in dealing with passive attacks is on prevention rather than detection.
Active Attacks
Active attacks involve some modification of the data stream or the creation of a
false stream and can be subdivided into four categories: replay, masquerade, modifi-
cation of messages, and denial of service.
A masquerade takes place when one entity pretends to be a different entity.
A masquerade attack usually includes one of the other forms of active attack. For
example, authentication sequences can be captured and replayed after a valid
authentication sequence has taken place, thus enabling an authorized entity with
few privileges to obtain extra privileges by impersonating an entity that has those
privileges.
Replay involves the passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent retrans-
mission to produce an unauthorized effect.
Data modification simply means that some portion of a legitimate message
is altered, or that messages are delayed or reordered, to produce an unauthorized
effect. For example, a message stating, "Allow John Smith to read confidential file
accounts" is modified to say, "Allow Fred Brown to read confidential file accounts."
The denial of service prevents or inhibits the normal use or management of
communication facilities. This attack may have a specific target; for example, an
entity may suppress all messages directed to a particular destination (e.g., the secu-
rity audit service). Another form of service denial is the disruption of an entire net-
work, either by disabling the network or by overloading it with messages so as to
degrade performance.
Active attacks present the opposite characteristics of passive attacks. Whereas
passive attacks are difficult to detect, measures are available to prevent their success.
On the other hand, it is quite difficult to prevent active attacks absolutely, because
to do so would require physical protection of all communication facilities and paths
at all times. Instead, the goal is to detect them and to recover from any disruption
or delays caused by them. Because the detection has a deterrent effect, it may also
contribute to prevention.
Figure 1.3 illustrates the types of attacks in the context of a client/server inter-
action. A passive attack (Figure 1.3b) does not disturb the information flow between
the client and server, but is able to observe that flow.
A masquerade can take the form of a man-in-the-middle attack (Figure 1.3c).
In this type of attack, the attacker intercepts masquerades as the client to the server
and as the server to the client. We see specific applications of this attack in defeat-
ing key exchange and distribution protocols (Chapters 10 and 14) and in message
authentication protocols (Chapter 11). More generally, it can be used to imperson-
ate the two ends of a legitimate communication. Another form of masquerade is
illustrated in Figure 1.3d. Here, an attacker is able to access server resources by mas-
querading as an authorized user.
Data modification may involve a man-in-the middle attack, in which the
attacker selectively modifies communicated data between a client and server

(Figure 1.3c). Another form of data modification attack is the modification of data
residing on a serve or other system after an attacker gains unauthorized access
(Figure 1.3d).
Figure 1.3e illustrates the replay attack. As in a passive attack, the attacker
does not disturb the information flow between client and server, but does capture
client message. The attacker can then subsequently replay any client message to the
server.
Figure 1.3d also illustrates denial of service in the context of a client/server
environment. The denial of service can take two forms: (1) flooding the server with
an overwhelming amount of data; and (2) triggering some action on the server that
consumes substantial computing resources.
1.4 SECURITY SERVICES
A security service is a capability that supports one or more of the security require-
ments (confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and accountability). Security
services implement security policies and are implemented by security mechanisms.
```



Page 11 

```text
1.4 / SECURITY SERVICES 31
The most important security services are shown in Figure 1.2b. We look at each
category in turn.2
Authentication
The authentication service is concerned with assuring that a communication is
authentic. In the case of a single message, such as a warning or alarm signal, the
function of the authentication service is to assure the recipient that the message is
from the source that it claims to be from. In the case of an ongoing interaction, such
as the connection of a client to a server, two aspects are involved. First, at the time
of connection initiation, the service assures that the two entities are authentic, that
is, that each is the entity that it claims to be. Second, the service must assure that the
connection is not interfered with in such a way that a third party can masquerade as
one of the two legitimate parties for the purposes of unauthorized transmission or
reception.
Two specific authentication services are defined in X.800:
■Peer entity authentication: Provides for the corroboration of the identity of a
peer entity in an association. Two entities are considered peers if they imple-
ment the same protocol in different systems; for example, two TCP modules in
two communicating systems. Peer entity authentication is provided for use at
the establishment of, or at times during the data transfer phase of, a connec-
tion. It attempts to provide confidence that an entity is not performing either a
masquerade or an unauthorized replay of a previous connection.
Data origin authentication: Provides for the corroboration of the source of
a data unit. It does not provide protection against the duplication or modifi-
cation of data units. This type of service supports applications like electronic
mail, where there are no ongoing interactions between the communicating
entities.
Access Control
In the context of network security, access control is the ability to limit and control
the access to host systems and applications via communications links. To achieve
this, each entity trying to gain access must first be identified, or authenticated, so
that access rights can be tailored to the individual.
Data Confidentiality
Confidentiality is the protection of transmitted data from passive attacks. With
respect to the content of a data transmission, several levels of protection can be
identified. The broadest service protects all user data transmitted between two users
2There is no universal agreement about many of the terms used in the security literature. For example,
the term integrity is sometimes used to refer to all aspects of information security. The term authentication
is sometimes used to refer both to verification of identity and to the various functions listed under
integrity in this chapter. Our usage here agrees with X.800.
```



Page 12 

```text
32 CHAPTER 1 / INFORMATION AND NETWORK SECURITY CONCEPTS
over a period of time. For example, when a TCP connection is set up between two
systems, this broad protection prevents the release of any user data transmitted over
the TCP connection. Narrower forms of this service can also be defined, including
the protection of a single message or even specific fields within a message. These
refinements are less useful than the broad approach and may even be more complex
and expensive to implement.
The other aspect of confidentiality is the protection of traffic flow from analy-
sis. This requires that an attacker not be able to observe the source and destination,
frequency, length, or other characteristics of the traffic on a communications facility.
Data Integrity
As with confidentiality, integrity can apply to a stream of messages, a single mes-
sage, or selected fields within a message. Again, the most useful and straightforward
approach is total stream protection.
A connection-oriented integrity service, one that deals with a stream of mes-
sages, assures that messages are received as sent with no duplication, insertion,
modification, reordering, or replays. The destruction of data is also covered under
this service. Thus, the connection-oriented integrity service addresses both message
stream modification and denial of service. On the other hand, a connectionless integ-
rity service, one that deals with individual messages without regard to any larger
context, generally provides protection against message modification only.
We can make a distinction between service with and without recovery. Because
the integrity service relates to active attacks, we are concerned with detection rather
than prevention. If a violation of integrity is detected, then the service may simply
report this violation, and some other portion of software or human intervention is
required to recover from the violation. Alternatively, there are mechanisms avail-
able to recover from the loss of integrity of data, as we will review subsequently. The
incorporation of automated recovery mechanisms is, in general, the more attractive
alternative.
Nonrepudiation
Nonrepudiation prevents either sender or receiver from denying a transmitted mes-
sage. Thus, when a message is sent, the receiver can prove that the alleged sender in
fact sent the message. Similarly, when a message is received, the sender can prove
that the alleged receiver in fact received the message.
Availability Service
Availability is the property of a system, or a system resource being accessible and
usable upon demand by an authorized system entity, according to performance
specifications for the system (i.e., a system is available if it provides services accord-
ing to the system design whenever users request them). A variety of attacks can
result in the loss of or reduction in availability. Some of these attacks are amenable
to automated countermeasures, such as authentication and encryption, whereas oth-
ers require some sort of physical action to prevent or recover from loss of availabil-
ity of elements of a distributed system.
```



Page 13 

1.6 / CRYPTOGRAPHY 33
X.800 treats availability as a property to be associated with various security
services. However, it makes sense to call out specifically an availability service. An
availability service is one that protects a system to ensure its availability. This service
addresses the security concerns raised by denial-of-service attacks. It depends on
proper management and control of system resources and thus depends on access
control service and other security services.
1.5 SECURITY MECHANISMS
Figure 1.2c lists the most important security mechanisms discussed in this book.
These mechanisms will be covered in the appropriate places in the book. So, we do
not elaborate now, except to provide the following brief definitions.
■ Cryptographic algorithms: We can distinguish between reversible crypto-
graphic mechanisms and irreversible cryptographic mechanisms. A reversible
cryptographic mechanism is simply an encryption algorithm that allows data
to be encrypted and subsequently decrypted. Irreversible cryptographic mech-
anisms include hash algorithms and message authentication codes, which are
used in digital signature and message authentication applications.
■Data integrity: This category covers a variety of mechanisms used to assure the
integrity of a data unit or stream of data units.
■Digital signature: Data appended to, or a cryptographic transformation of,
a data unit that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and
integrity of the data unit and protect against forgery.
■ Authentication exchange: A mechanism intended to ensure the identity of an
entity by means of information exchange.
■ Traffic padding: The insertion of bits into gaps in a data stream to frustrate
traffic analysis attempts.
■ Routing control: Enables selection of particular physically or logically secure
routes for certain data and allows routing changes, especially when a breach of
security is suspected.
■ Notarization: The use of a trusted third party to assure certain properties of a
data exchange.
■ Access control: A variety of mechanisms that enforce access rights to
resources.
1.6 CRYPTOGRAPHY
Cryptography is a branch of mathematics that deals with the transformation of
data. Cryptographic algorithms are used in many ways in information security and
network security. Cryptography is an essential component in the secure storage
and transmission of data, and in the secure interaction between parties. Parts Two
through Five are devoted to this topic. Here we provide a very brief overview.

                               Figure 1.4 Cryptographic Algorithms
        Cryptographic algorithms can be divided into three categories (Figure 1.4):
        ■ Keyless: Do not use any keys during cryptographic transformations.
        Single-key: The result of a transformation is a function of the input data and a
          single key, known as a secret key.
        ■ Two-key: At various stages of the calculation, two different but related keys
          are used, referred to as a private key and a public key.
        Keyless Algorithms
        Keyless algorithms are deterministic functions that have certain properties useful
        for cryptography.
            One important type of keyless algorithm is the cryptographic hash function. A
        hash function turns a variable amount of text into a small, fixed-length value called
        a hash value, hash code, or digest. A cryptographic hash function is one that has
        additional properties that make it useful as part of another cryptographic algorithm,
        such as a message authentication code or a digital signature.
              A pseudorandom number generator produces a deterministic sequence
        of numbers or bits that has the appearance of being a truly random sequence.
        Although the sequence appears to lack any definite pattern, it will repeat after a cer-
        tain sequence length. Nevertheless, for some cryptographic purposes this apparently
        random sequence is sufficient.
        Single-Key Algorithms
        Single-key cryptographic algorithms depend on the use of a secret key. This key may
        be known to a single user; for example, this is the case for protecting stored data that
        is only going to be accessed by the data creator. Commonly, two parties share the

secret key so that communication between the two parties is protected. For certain
applications, more than two users may share the same secret key. In this last case, the
algorithm protects data from those outside the group who share the key.
Encryption algorithms that use a single key are referred to as symmetric
encryption algorithms. With symmetric encryption, an encryption algorithm takes
as input some data to be protected and a secret key and produces an unintelligi-
ble transformation on that data. A corresponding decryption algorithm takes the
transformed data and the same secret key and recovers the original data. Symmetric
encryption takes the following forms:
■ Block cipher: A block cipher operates on data as a sequence of blocks. A typi-
cal block size is 128 bits. In most versions of the block cipher, known as modes
of operation, the transformation depends not only on the current data block
and the secret key but also on the content of preceding blocks.
■ Stream cipher: A stream cipher operates on data as a sequence of bits. Typically,
an exclusive-OR operation is used to produce a bit-by-bit transformation. As
with the block cipher, the transformation depends on a secret key.
Another form of single-key cryptographic algorithm is the message authen-
tication code (MAC). A MAC is a data element associated with a data block or
message. The MAC is generated by a cryptographic transformation involving a
secret key and, typically, a cryptographic hash function of the message. The MAC
is designed so that someone in possession of the secret key can verify the integ-
rity of the message. Thus, the MAC algorithm takes as input a message and secret
key and produces the MAC. The recipient of the message plus the MAC can per-
form the same calculation on the message; if the calculated MAC matches the
MAC accompanying the message, this provides assurance that the message has
not been altered.
Two-Key Algorithms
Two-key algorithms involve the use of two related keys. A private key is known only
to a single user or entity, whereas the corresponding public key is made available
to a number of users. Encryption algorithms that use two keys are referred to as
asymmetric encryption algorithms. Asymmetric encryption can work in two ways:
1. An encryption algorithm takes as input some data to be protected and the
private key and produces an unintelligible transformation on that data. A
corresponding decryption algorithm takes the transformed data and the
corresponding public key and recovers the original data. In this case, only the
possessor of the private key can have performed the encryption and any pos-
sessor of the public key can perform the decryption.
2. An encryption algorithm takes as input some data to be protected and a
public key and produces an unintelligible transformation on that data. A cor-
responding decryption algorithm takes the transformed data and the corre-
sponding private key and recovers the original data. In this case, any possessor
of the public key can have performed the encryption and only the possessor of
the private key can perform the decryption.

36 CHAPTER 1 / INFORMATION AND NETWORK SECURITY CONCEPTS
Asymmetric encryption has a variety of applications. One of the most impor-
tant is the digital signature algorithm. A digital signature is a value computed with
a cryptographic algorithm and associated with a data object in such a way that any
recipient of the data can use the signature to verify the data's origin and integrity.
Typically, the signer of a data object uses the signer's private key to generate the
signature, and anyone in possession of the corresponding public key can verify that
validity of the signature.
Asymmetric algorithms can also be used in two other important applica-
tions. Key exchange is the process of securely distributing a symmetric key to
two or more parties. User authentication is the process of authenticating that a
user attempting to access an application or service is genuine and, similarly, that
the application or service is genuine. These concepts are explained in detail in
subsequent chapters.
1.7 NETWORK SECURITY
Network security is a broad term that encompasses security of the communications
pathways of the network and the security of network devices and devices attached
to the network (Figure 1.5).
Communications Security
In the context of network security, communications security deals with the protec-
tion of communications through the network, including measures to protect against
both passive and active attacks (Figure 1.3).
Communications security is primarily implemented using network protocols.
A network protocol consists of the format and procedures that governs the trans-
mitting and receiving of data between points in a network. A protocol defines the
structure of the individual data units (e.g., packets) and the control commands that
manage the data transfer.
With respect to network security, a security protocol may be an enhancement
that is part of an existing protocol or a standalone protocol. Examples of the former
are IPsec, which is part of the Internet Protocol (IP) and IEEE 802.11i, which is
part of the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. Examples of the latter are Transport Layer
Security (TLS) and Secure Shell (SSH). Part Six examines these and other secure
network protocols.
One common characteristic of all of these protocols is that they use a number
of cryptographic algorithms as part of the mechanism to provide security.
Device Security
The other aspect of network security is the protection of network devices, such as
routers and switches, and end systems connected to the network, such as client sys-
tems and servers. The primary security concerns are intruders that gain access to
the system to perform unauthorized actions, insert malicious software (malware), or
overwhelm system resources to diminish availability. Three types of device security
are noteworthy:

■ Firewall: A hardware and/or software capability that limits access between a
network and devices attached to the network, in accordance with a specific
security policy. The firewall acts as a filter that permits or denies data traffic,
both incoming and outgoing, using a set of rules based on traffic content and/
or traffic pattern.
■Intrusion detection: Hardware or software products that gather and analyze
information from various areas within a computer or a network for the pur-
pose of finding, and providing real-time or near-real-time warning of, attempts
to access system resources in an unauthorized manner.
■Intrusion prevention: Hardware or software products designed to detect intru-
sive activity and attempt to stop the activity, ideally before it reaches its target.
These device security capabilities are more closely related to the field of
computer security than network security. Accordingly, they are dealt with more
briefly than communications security in Part Six. For a more detailed treatment, see
[STAL18].
1.8 TRUST AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
The concepts of trust and trustworthiness are key concepts in computer and network
security [SCHN91]. It will be useful to look first at a generalized model of trust and
trustworthiness, and then apply these concepts to the topic of information security.

38 CHAPTER 1 / INFORMATION AND NETWORK SECURITY CONCEPTS
A Trust Model
One of the most widely accepted and most cited definitions of trust in the organi-
zational science literature is from [MAYE95], which defines trust as follows: the
willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the
expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the truster,
irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party.
Three related concepts are relevant to a trust model:
■ Trustworthiness: A characteristic of an entity that reflects the degree to which
that entity is deserving of trust.
■Propensity to trust: A tendency to be willing to trust others across a broad
spectrum of situations and trust targets. This suggests that every individual has
some baseline level of trust that will influence the person's willingness to rely
on the words and actions of others.
■ Risk: A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a poten-
tial circumstance or event, and typically a function of 1) the adverse impacts
that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and 2) the likelihood of
occurrence.
Figure 1.6, adapted from [MAYE95], illustrates the relationship among these
concepts. Trust is a function of the truster's propensity to trust and the perceived
trustworthiness of the trustee. Propensity can also be expressed as the level of risk
that an entity (individual or organization) is prepared to tolerate.
Typically, a truster uses a number of factors to establish the trustworthiness of
an entity. Three general factors are commonly cited:
■Ability: Also referred to as competence, this relates to the potential ability of
the evaluated entity to do a given task or be entrusted with given information.
■ Benevolence: This implies a disposition of goodwill towards the trusting party.
That is, a trustworthy party does not intend to cause harm to the trusting party.
■Integrity: This can be defined as the truster's perception that the trustee
adheres to a set of principles that the truster finds acceptable. Integrity implies
that a benevolent party takes such measures are necessary to assure that it in
fact does not cause harm to the trusting party.
The goal of trust, in the model of Figure 1.6, is to determine what course of
action, if any, the trusting party is willing to take in relation to the trusted party.
Based on the level of trust, and the perceived risk, the trusting party may decide to
take some action that involves some degree of risk taking. The outcome of the risk
taking could be a reliance on the trusted party to perform some action or the disclo-
sure of information to the trusted party with the expectation that the information
will be protected as agreed between the parties.
The Trust Model and Information Security
Trust is confidence that an entity will perform in a way the will not prejudice the
security of the user of the system of which that entity is a part. Trust is always
restricted to specific functions or ways of behavior and is meaningful only in the

context of a security policy. Generally, an entity is said to trust a second entity when
the first entity assumes that the second entity will behave exactly as the first entity
expects. This trust may apply only for some specific function. In this context, the
term entity may refer to a single hardware component or software module, a piece
of equipment identified by make and model, a site or location, or an organization.
TRUSTWORTHINESS OF AN INDIVIDUAL Organizations need to be concerned about both
internal users (employees, on-site contractors) and external users (customers, suppli-
ers) of their information systems. With respect to internal users, an organization de-
velops a level of trust in individuals by policies in the following two areas [STAL19]:
■ Human resource security: Sound security practice dictates that information
security requirements be embedded into each stage of the employment life
cycle, specifying security-related actions required during the induction of each
individual, their ongoing management, and termination of their employment.
Human resource security also includes assigning ownership of information
(including responsibility for its protection) to capable individuals and obtain-
ing confirmation of their understanding and acceptance.
■ Security awareness and training: This area refers to disseminating security
information to all employees, including IT staff, IT security staff, and manage-
ment, as well as IT users and other employees. A workforce that has a high
level of security awareness and appropriate security training for each indi-
vidual's role is as important, if not more important, than any other security
countermeasure or control.
For external users, trust will depend on the context. In general terms, the fac-
tors of perceived trustworthiness and the truster's propensity, as depicted in Figure 1.6,
determine the level of trust. Further, the issue of trust is mutual. That is, not only must
an organization determine a level of trust towards external users, but external users
```

need to be concerned about the degree to which they can trust an information resource
that they use. This mutual trust involves a number a practical consequences, including
the use of a public-key infrastructure and user authentication protocols. These matters
are explored in Part Five.
TRUSTWORTHINESS OF AN ORGANIZATION Most organizations rely, to a greater or
lesser extent, on information system service and information provided by external
organizations, as well as partnerships to accomplish missions and business functions.
Examples are cloud service providers and companies that form part of the supply
chain for the organization. To manage risk to the organization, it must establish
trust relationships with these external organizations. NIST SP 800-39 (Managing
Information Security Risk, March 2011) indicates that such trust relationships can be:
■ Formally established, for example, by documenting the trust-related informa-
tion in contracts, service-level agreements, statements of work, memoranda of
agreement/understanding, or interconnection security agreements;
■ Scalable and inter-organizational or intra-organizational in nature; and/or
■ Represented by simple (bilateral) relationships between two partners or more
complex many-to-many relationships among many diverse partners.
The requirements for establishing and maintaining trust depend on mis-
sion/business requirements, the participants involved in the trust relationship, the
criticality/sensitivity of the information being shared or the types of services being
rendered, the history between the organizations, and the overall risk to the organiza-
tions participating in the relationship.
As with individuals, trust related to organizations can involve the use of
public-key infrastructure and user authentication, as well as the network security
measures described in Part Six.
TRUSTWORTHINESS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS SP 800-39 defines trustworthiness for
information systems as the degree to which information systems (including the in-
formation technology products from which the systems are built) can be expected
to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being
processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems across the full range of threats. Two
factors affecting the trustworthiness of information systems are:
■ Security functionality: The security features/functions employed within the
system. These include cryptographic and network security technologies dis-
cussed throughout this book.
■ Security assurance: The grounds for confidence that the security functionality
is effective in its application. This area is addressed by security management
techniques, such as auditing and incorporating security considerations into the
system development life cycle [STAL19].
Establishing Trust Relationships
The methods used by an organization to establish a trust relationship with various enti-
ties will depend on a variety of factors, such as laws and regulations, risk tolerance, and the
criticality and sensitivity of the relationship. SP 800-39 describes the following methods:
```

1.9 / STANDARDS 41
■ Validated trust: Trust is based on evidence obtained by the trusting organization
about the trusted organization or entity. The information may include informa-
tion security policy, security measures, and level of oversight. An example would
be for one organization to develop an application or information system and pro-
vide evidence (e.g., security plan, assessment results) to a second organization that
supports the claims by the first organization that the application/system meets
certain security requirements and/or addresses the appropriate security controls.
■Direct historical trust: This type of trust is based on the security-related track
record exhibited by an organization in the past, particularly in interactions
with the organization seeking to establish trust.
■ Mediated trust: Mediated trust involves the use of a third party that is mutu-
ally trusted by two parties, with the third party providing assurance or guar-
antee of a given level of trust between the first two parties. An example of
this form of trust establishment is the use of public-key certificate authorities,
described in Chapter 14.
■ Mandated trust: An organization establishes a level of trust with another orga-
nization based on a specific mandate issued by a third party in a position of
authority. For example, an organization may be given the responsibility and
the authority to issue public key certificates for a group of organizations.
An organization is likely to use a combination of these methods to establish
relationships with a number of other entities.
1.9 STANDARDS
Many of the security techniques and applications described in this book have
been specified as standards. Additionally, standards have been developed to cover
management practices and the overall architecture of security mechanisms and
services. Throughout this book, we describe the most important standards in use
or being developed for various aspects of cryptography and network security.
Various organizations have been involved in the development or promotion of
these standards. The most important (in the current context) of these organiza-
tions are as follows:
■ National Institute of Standards and Technology: NIST is a U.S. federal agency
that deals with measurement science, standards, and technology related to
U.S. government use and to the promotion of U.S. private-sector innovation.
Despite its national scope, NIST Federal Information Processing Standards
(FIPS) and Special Publications (SP) have a worldwide impact.
■Internet Society: ISOC is a professional membership society with worldwide
organizational and individual membership. It provides leadership in address-
ing issues that confront the future of the Internet and is the organization home
for the groups responsible for Internet infrastructure standards, including the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Architecture Board
(IAB). These organizations develop Internet standards and related specifica-
tions, all of which are published as Requests for Comments (RFCs).

■ ITU-T: The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is an international
organization within the United Nations System in which governments and
the private sector coordinate global telecom networks and services. The ITU
Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is one of the three sectors of
the ITU. ITU-T's mission is the development of technical standards covering all
fields of telecommunications. ITU-T standards are referred to as Recommendations.
■ ISO: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a worldwide
federation of national standards bodies from more than 140 countries, one from
each country. ISO is a nongovernmental organization that promotes the devel-
opment of standardization and related activities with a view to facilitating the
international exchange of goods and services and to developing cooperation in
the spheres of intellectual, scientific, technological, and economic activity. ISO's
work results in international agreements that are published as International
Standards.
